# Disappointment Minimiser

My solution to the 8th problem for CO2021 from JPM
Problem can be founde here https://github.com/perhammer/guts-code-olympics-2021#8-disappointment-minimiser-hard-125-150

My solution uses a first come, first serve algorithm where tasks are assigned to the first team that requests them, as long as those tasks aren't worked on by enough teams already.
